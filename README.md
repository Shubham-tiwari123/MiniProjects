## Mini Project on (HPC, AIR ,DA)

### High-performance computing(HPC):

Used **Multithreading concept** of JAVA to show parallel computation on bubble sort. 

**Steps**

	1. Divided the main array into n subarrays.
	
	2. Sorted each subarray using thread.
	
	3. Merged the sorted arrays to form the original sorted array.
	
Developed front-end using JSP and Servlet called **MathClass**.

### Artificial Intelligence and Robotics(AIR):

Implemented **Best First Search** algorithm, a type of Heuristic Search algo

**Steps**

	1. Created a weighted graph with 5 vertices and 7 edges connecting the edges.
	
	2. Accepts the start point and end point from user.
	
	3. Implement the best first search to find the optimal path.
	
	4. Returned the path to the user.
	
Developed front-end using JSP and Servlet called **FindMePath**.
